# RFC2136 DNS Challenge Provider

The `rfc2136` DNS challenge provider can be used to perform DNS challenges for
the [`acme_certificate`][resource-acme-certificate] resource with
[RFC2136](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2136).

[resource-acme-certificate]: /docs/providers/acme/r/certificate.html

For complete information on how to use this provider with the `acme_certifiate`
resource, see [here][resource-acme-certificate-dns-challenges].

[resource-acme-certificate-dns-challenges]: /docs/providers/acme/r/certificate.html#using-dns-challenges

## Example

```hcl
resource "acme_certificate" "certificate" {
  ...

  dns_challenge {
    provider = "rfc2136"
  }
}
```
## Argument Reference

The following arguments can be either passed as environment variables, or
directly through the `config` block in the
[`dns_challenge`][resource-acme-certificate-dns-challenge-arg] argument in the
[`acme_certificate`][resource-acme-certificate] resource. For more details, see
[here][resource-acme-certificate-dns-challenges].

In addition, arguments can also be stored in a local file, with the path
supplied by supplying the argument with the `_FILE` suffix. See
[here][acme-certificate-file-arg-example] for more information.
